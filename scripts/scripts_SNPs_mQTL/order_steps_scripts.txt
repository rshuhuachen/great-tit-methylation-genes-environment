
# to assess DNA methylation levels at CpG site specifically and to call SNPS, we used the epiGBS2 bioinformatics pipeline (Gawehns et al., 2022) with minor modifications described in the manuscript
# before calling SNPs, RG-tags were added to the reads

# info.txt : python scripts and their input and output files/directories

# add_tags.py : python script to add RG-tags to the reads

# once RG-tags were added, SNP-calling was done with the epiGBS2 pipeline (https://github.com/nioo-knaw/epiGBS2/blob/epiGBS2v3/README.md)
